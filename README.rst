Transfer Large files
====================

To transfer a large file from one server to another without worrying about timeouts or dropped connections 
use rsync instead of scp:

    ::
        
        rsync -v --partial --progress --rsh=ssh local_file user@server:remote_file
        rsync -rvz --partial --progress --rsh='ssh -p 17235' local_file user@server:remote_file

Undo SVN Add
============

Adding new files and directories to SVN can sometimes include files and directories that should not be
included.  Remove them via the following command:

    ::
    
        svn rm --keep-local FILENAME
